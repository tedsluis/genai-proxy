# Feature Specification: Configure corporate internet proxy support

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-the-ability`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add the ability to configure a corperated internet proxy. - Enable the proxy when the environment variable HTTPS_PROXY is set, for example with http://proxy.domain.org:8080 - there is no authentication on the corperated proxy."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Enable proxy via environment (Priority: P1)

Operators can enable outbound HTTP(S) requests to go through the corporate proxy by setting the environment variable `HTTPS_PROXY` (e.g., `http://proxy.domain.org:8080`). When set, the proxy applies to all upstream requests and health checks made by the service.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the service works in corporate networks where direct internet access is restricted, enabling immediate operability.

**Independent Test**: Start the service with `HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.domain.org:8080` (reachable test proxy). Verify outbound calls (e.g., `/v1/health` and OpenAI-compatible endpoints) succeed through the proxy by observing logs or proxy access logs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given `HTTPS_PROXY` is set to a valid proxy URL, When the service makes an outbound request, Then the request is routed through the proxy.
2. Given `HTTPS_PROXY` is not set, When the service makes an outbound request, Then the request is sent directly without using a proxy.

---

### User Story 2 - No authentication on proxy (Priority: P2)

The corporate proxy does not require credentials. The service must not prompt for authentication nor attempt to use proxy auth headers.

**Why this priority**: Avoids configuration complexity and errors, matching the current environment where proxy access is unrestricted.

**Independent Test**: With `HTTPS_PROXY` set to a proxy that does not require authentication, verify that outbound requests succeed and no proxy authorization headers are sent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given `HTTPS_PROXY` is set, When the service sends requests, Then it does not include proxy authorization headers and succeeds if the proxy permits.

---

### User Story 3 - Clear observability (Priority: P3)

Operators can see in logs whether the proxy is enabled and which proxy address is configured, including request IDs for troubleshooting.

**Why this priority**: Improves diagnosability when connectivity issues occur in proxied environments.

**Independent Test**: Start with/without `HTTPS_PROXY` and verify startup logs show proxy status. For requests, confirm logs include request IDs and upstream URL.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the service starts, When `HTTPS_PROXY` is set, Then startup logs show `HTTPS_PROXY` value with redaction of credentials if present (none expected).
2. Given a request is made, When proxy is enabled, Then logs include request ID and upstream, consistent with existing logging.

### Edge Cases

- Invalid proxy URL in `HTTPS_PROXY` (malformed): service should log an error on first outbound request and return a `proxy_error` (HTTP 502) for that request.
- Proxy unreachable or connection refused: service should retry according to existing retry policy and ultimately return `proxy_error` (HTTP 502).
- Environment sets `HTTP_PROXY` instead of `HTTPS_PROXY`: by default only `HTTPS_PROXY` is honored per requirement; document that `HTTP_PROXY` is ignored unless added in future.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The service MUST read the environment variable `HTTPS_PROXY` at startup.
- FR-002: When `HTTPS_PROXY` is set, the service MUST route outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests through this proxy.
- FR-003: When `HTTPS_PROXY` is not set, the service MUST route outbound requests directly without a proxy.
- FR-004: The service MUST NOT send proxy authentication headers.
- FR-005: The service MUST log whether proxy is enabled, and the proxy address.
- FR-006: On malformed proxy configuration or unreachable proxy, the service MUST log errors and map failures to `proxy_error` responses as per existing behavior.

### Key Entities

- Proxy Configuration: A single environment-derived setting indicating the proxy URL to be used for outbound requests.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: With a valid `HTTPS_PROXY`, 95% of outbound requests succeed on first attempt in proxied environments.
- SC-002: Startup log includes a clear proxy status line within 1 second of service start.
- SC-003: When `HTTPS_PROXY` is unset, outbound requests function identically to current behavior.
- SC-004: Operators can verify proxy routing via logs or external proxy access logs without additional configuration.# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->
